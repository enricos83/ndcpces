The folder contains the instances used for the experiments of the ICAPS-21 paper "Non-Deterministic Conformant Planning Using a Counterexample-GuidedIncremental Compilation to Classical Planning"
Instances are collected on planner by planner basis as mbp and k1k0 uses slightly different PDDL syntax than what you used by ndcpces.

mbp and k1k0 have been provided by the respective authors
ndcpces can be found in this repository
